## About School Management System Laravel Project
In particular, this School Management System project in PHP Laravel focuses mainly on keeping track of the school’s overall records. To be more precise, the system helps to keep track of all the students along with parents, teachers, classes, and so on(codeastro.com). Also, the system contains all the attendance management side of things too. In addition, the system allows for managing subjects and reports. Evidently, this project contains an admin panel with students, teachers, and parents panel. In an overview of this web application, a student has limited features to it. Speaking of which it means the user can only view his/her profile, enrolled subjects, and available attendance report. Besides, the student can update their profiles too.


# Admin Panel
An administrator has full control over the system. He/she can manage all the students, teachers, parents, classes, and more. Here, each and every section has its own respective details such as name, id, and other important details (codeastro.com). Just before anything else, this school management system project in Laravel does not have self-registration features for any users. Before moving further into the system, the admin has to first manage the teacher’s record. For this, the user has to provide a number of details. Such as name, date of birth, email, password, address, and gender with his/her photo. Later, the user can use the teacher’s login credentials to log in as a teacher. Sections such as class and subject management are linked with the teacher’s record.


# Subjects and Classes
As mentioned earlier, before proceeding towards these sections, it is a must that the system should contain any teacher’s record. The admin can manage subjects for each class. There are various required fields under the subjects section. That includes the name of the subject with its code, teacher, and short description. With it, the user can also add and manage classes by providing a number of details. Such as the name of the class, numeric, selection of class teacher, and class description(codeastro.com). In this way, we can see how the teacher’s record has been interconnected to these sections. In terms of classes, there’s another section “Students” which is set automatically by the system once the user adds students under a particular class. And at last, the admin has to assign subjects to each available class.


# Students and Parents
Moving on, the admin has to manage parents before adding up students’ data. In order to add parents’ records, the user has to enter the parent’s name, email, address, address, gender, contact number, and photo(codeastro.com). After setting up parents’ details, the user can now easily add student details. Here in the student management section, the system requires various information. Such as the name of the student, gender, email, password, class, contact, parents, address, and photo. With this action, the system automatically interconnects a student with their parents. Meaning, that parents can now see their children’s profiles and attendance reports from their dashboards. A parent’s account can hold more than one child/student’s record. The only motive of the parent’s panel is to check up on their children’s detail and attendance.


# Teacher’s Panel
Moving on to the teacher’s panel contains limited features but it plays an important role in the management of student attendance. In fact, this role can also be called some kind of Student Attendance Management System. Logging in as a teacher in this school management system project allows you to check up on enrolled students along with classes. Speaking of classes, each class holds its own number of students. And with that comes settling of attendance. A teacher can maintain attendance at each class on each date. The teacher can view their assigned subject list too(codeastro.com). Attendance management from the teacher’s panel is very much easy. All you’ve to do is enter a class, and select an action for each available student. The teacher has to either mark a student as present or absent. Other things such as dates are automatically arranged by the system.



# Attendance Report and More
Moreover, an administrator can view the overall attendance of students in each class. Under this section, the admin just has to select the month for generating a report. For your information, the system only allows filtering the current month’s report. As a result, the system displays all the available attendance reports from each student and class under the current month. All the present students are denoted with the letter ‘P’ whereas absent are denoted with the letter ‘A’ in green and red color respectively. The administrator can also assign user roles and manage their permissions(codeastro.com). In terms of user roles, the admin has to provide a username, email, password, and select role. Besides, the user can view and update their profiles.
